      <p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles housing organizers and lawyers formed a coalition called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.keeplahoused.org/">Keep LA Housed</a>. Since its inception, Keep LA Housed has been dedicated to expanding temporary tenant protections and codifying permanent ones in the City of LA and LA County. </p>
        
        <p>What emerged was a holistic policy framework, the Tenant Bill of Rights (TBOR), consisting of nine policies designed to keep tenants housed, protect tenants from harassment, and provide tenants with economic and legal support when they face eviction.</p>

        <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
              <th>The nine policies include:</th>
          </tr>

        <tbody>

          </tr>

          </tr>
          <tr>

          </tr>
          <tr>

          </tr>
          <tr>

        <p>On this map, we visualize the extent to which each jurisdiction in Los Angeles County–88 cities and unincorporated Los Angeles County–have enacted TBOR policies into law. Cities are ranked on a 0-9 scale, represented by a blue color gradient from light (few to no enacted policies) to dark purple (many enacted policies).</p>
        <br>
        <h5>What do the scores mean? </h5>
        <p>You can find the rubric that we used to classify each city here:</p>
